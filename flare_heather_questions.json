Amy, a question for you. You commented on the positive spread that you're seeing in the Windows OEM business, both overall, but particularly on the commercial side. When you start to think forward in the next, call it couple quarters here, obviously you told us what the positive drivers were. But how do you see those playing out and can we maintain that positive spread? If so, why? If it does maybe narrow, how do you think about the narrowing?"]}, {"name": "market", "questions": ["Thanks very much. Satya, I want to direct to you, if I could. I'd like to understand how you view Dynamics' current position compared to the market opportunities. The context of the question is, Dynamics remains a fairly small part of Microsoft revenues. As well, if you look at the market share of where Dynamics serve, it's a fairly part of the market serve. What do you think Microsoft needs to do to have a larger connect against the market opportunities?"]}, {"name": "seat", "questions": ["Thank you very much. I'll add my congrats. Amy, we keep expecting the Office 365 commercial seat growth to decelerate materially at some point based upon the penetration level. But this quarter, that seat growth actually accelerated about a point to 29%. When we look back on it, the trajectory really isn't too different than where it was even a year ago. I'm just curious, is there some underlying driver there that would keep that deceleration relatively manageable going forward or would you continue to see that slowing in a way that over time would exert a little drag on Azure through the per-user Azure services?"]}]}
