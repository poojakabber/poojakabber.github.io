{"data": [{"name": "margin side", "questions": ["I was wondering, Peter, if you can help -- we've heard Intel talk about Haswell and they mentioned it on the call I think it was last night, you obviously mentioned it. I guess I'm just wondering, what can you guys do to specifically help grow your tablet share, given you are reliant ex the Surface products on OEM partners to really hit a broad segment of the market? And I'm thinking in general given the OEM partners don't have much wiggle room on the margin side, what can you do to help stimulate your market share in particular in the mobility and then the tablet side? Thank you. And good luck in the future. We're going to miss you."]}]}
