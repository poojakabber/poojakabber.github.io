I just was wondering, you talked about the entry of a lot of new SKUs that are coming out for the holiday season. As we start thinking about building our OEM models, how do we think about ASPs for this 8-inch and below category that you referenced there is a lot of product coming out with?", "Great, thank you very much. My question was related to you mentioned some what like T-Mobile for example meaningful upsell component. I was just wondering if you could share with us what are the biggest upsell products that you are seeing today and if that is different from maybe what you were noticing six to 12 months ago? And then the follow-up question would be if you could give us some color qualitatively around how ASPs trended this quarter versus last quarter?", "OKay. Yes. No, I was just wondering specifically if you had any stats that you could share directionally. How many -- kind of how multi-product customers and maybe the average number of products per customer.", "I was wondering again, and sorry Tony to drill down on this, but following up on what Michael just asked. The people that came out of the woodwork and had more influence on the deals than you thought, is there a common thread as to why they held up the deal signing? Was it macro, was it competition, was it they need more time with the product? Is there any common thread that you can share with us?", "Great. Thank you very much. Just had a couple questions. One, I was wondering if you could give us a sense of how you feel like your EAA progression has been going versus your expectations? And there's a lot of questions that we field during the quarter that as you guys progress there, what happens to pricing, what type of pricing trends are you seeing? And then the follow-up would be on the multi-product front, which you guys talked about a little bit earlier. Can you give us a sense of the percentage of deals -- I know it's early -- that included more than one product in the quarter and how you would expect us to think about that ramp? Thank you.", "Great. Thank you very much. I wanted to ask a little bit about, following up on Jason's question, about the productivity of the sales reps. The first thing we should start with, I did not hear you give a net new customer count for the quarter. I was wondering if you had that to share? And then I have a couple of follow-ups?", "So then how do you think about -- how do you grade the productivity of your sales reps given the numbers that you are signing is either high single or low double-digits each quarter versus the number of reps that you have?", "Okay great thank you for that and just on HipChat, the trends we are seeing around are attach and cross sell into the installed base. Obviously there was a product you guys acquired a couple of years ago. How do you see that attach and cross sell ramping?", "Great, thank you. Satya, I know that Brent asked you about Azure, but I'm just wondering if you could share with us, you mentioned that compute usage on Azure, I think you said more than doubled or nearly doubled, something to that effect. I'm just wondering if you could share with us how you see paths coming along and where do you think we are in getting the easier workloads to the cloud? And are you now starting to see the inflection, given we did see an inflection in growth on a year-over-year basis this quarter where you are starting to see significant production workloads that are on-premise actually starting to move over as well?", "Thank you. In response to the past few questions on sales, I guess I'm wondering, do you also need to see changes in terms of how the sales force is structured in order to get that solution sale that you were referencing to keep before? It seems as if you're talking about specialist sales, but it also seems as if you're looking to start out initially with a broader footprint at the time of initial sales with a broader product footprint. I'm just wondering how do you marry that strategy, and also how important is the SI community in helping you to drive that? Thank you.", "Great. Most of mine have been answered but thank you for taking the questions. I guess I just had one. I was wondering if you could share with us a little bit of, kind of how you are thinking about HipChat and Bitbucket. And just share with us maybe any cross sell trends, into the install base. And in general, maybe how you see your product starting to -- your portfolio of products permeating through an organization. And then I have a couple of follow-ups.", "Great. Thank you so much. I had a question about RHEL 7, and just knowing that customers who are obviously paying maintenance will get that version, how do you think about it from the new capabilities that it might offer that might drive people to add on more products, like Charlie was just mentioning? Or the ability maybe to move to higher end SKUs? And just trying to get a sense of how fast you think the new capabilities you're delivering will kind of be absorbed into the market, and then potentially help accelerate things on the billing side as we look to next year. Thank you.", "Great. Thank you very much, and congratulations. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the leverage you all think you can get out of your desktop install base as you go into accounts with your MDM solutions.

And one follow-up question. In terms of you mentioned the sales force being somewhat preoccupied with on the XenMobile side. Maybe taking away from some time it might depend on traditional XenDesktop sales. Is this an area where you think eventually you'll need a specialized sales force, or do you do see them coming up to speed on the product and selling them all together?", "Great, thank you. I wanted to follow-up, and nice quarter guys, with some comments that Paul made talking about Atomic and talking about open stack. I was just wondering if you could share with us how you characterize kind of the biggest pain points that customers are facing right now as they look at these technologies to help them?

I was wondering if you could share with us the decision recently to offer Windows for free for sub-9-inch devices, and how you think this impacts your share in that arena? And also, how should we think about Windows pricing, given your comment about how Windows is going to play in different market segmentations, how do we see Windows pricing evolving, if at all, for other types of form factors over time?", "Great, thank you so much for your time. I wanted to ask a question about, Satya, about your comment about combining the next version of Windows into one for all devices. And just wondering if you look out, you've got different SKU segmentations right now, you've got enterprise, you've got consumer less than 9 inches for free. The offering that you mentioned earlier that you recently announced, how do we think about when you come out with this one version for all devices, how do you see this changing the go to market and also the traditional SKU segmentation and pricing that we've seen in the past?", "I just wanted to follow up, Amy. Your Commercial Other business continues to have fantastic growth. I'm wondering when you juxtapose that with the growth in the commercial licensing business -- I heard you in terms of the headwinds that you face -- but when we think about it more than one quarter out, we think about the revenue transition as you guys continue to build market share in the cloud, how do we think about the trend in the commercial licensing business in the next year or so?", "Two questions, one was related to the success of the sub-$250 machines that you guys and the market have been seeing. What geos have seen the best uptake for those so far? And just if there is a little bit more color you could share about the drivers of the commercial licensing business. I recognize, obviously, that you guys just give guidance for Q4. But as we look out over the next year or two, what are the big puts and takes, in particular, maybe, on the server and tool side that we need to think about?", "Great.

I just wanted to focus, David, on what you think -- I know you're going to announce the review of the operational procedures that you have been going through. But at least going back to Mark Moerdler's original question, when you think about the operational efficiencies and how far you are through what you have been able to achieve, can you give us a sense of ex those, how much more there is left in what you originally we laid out in -- I think it was in January? And then I had a follow up just on the MDM market, following up a little bit on the comments that were made last night. Growth rates for those businesses seem to have slowed for everyone in the market. Just trying to get a sense of what you're seeing from a pricing and bundling perspective. Thank you.", "And then the MDM market?", "Great. Thank you. Just two quick questions. One, David, I was wondering, I know it's early, but in November you gave us some early color on calendar 2017. I'm just wondering if you could give us a sense of, given Q4 results, if you could update us on whether or not that still stands. And then just another question -- and I apologize if this was asked, I was on another call -- you had a competitor last night talking about market share gains. I'm just wondering if you could give a little bit of color on what you're seeing in the end user computing market and how you see the competitive environment evolving. Thank you.", "Great. Thank you. I was just wondering if you could give us a little bit more color on what's driving the increased win rates in virtual computing?

And I'm just wondering if you think it would be important for Red Hat to be involved in that area over time, or would it make sense for you to own the complete stack at some point?", "Great. Thank you very much. I wanted to touch on two quick ones. One, you mentioned that ex those federal deals your contract renewals would have been at about 110%. I'm just wondering if you could put that in context. You guys have been running 120% or better for a while. What type of trend are you seeing that might be ticking that lower? I was also wondering if you could share with us a little bit, as you see more and more workloads go to places like AWS, how you think about the share that you have of the total Linux market versus the share you have on premise? Thank you.", "I just had a couple. I was wondering if you could share with us your hiring plans on the sale side on this year. Do you expect to increase it? I know you don't want to give a number, but can you give us an idea for what percentage growth we might see? And then also, I'm just wondering, given the go-to-market change, what do you see as key in the eyes of customers as helping differentiate you from the competition as a result?", "Okay. And then, I just had a quick follow-up, in regards to, I think it was Rick who asked about pricing. I'm just wondering, do you think the pricing trends that you're seeing are also a function of some of your competitors being a little bit more rational in the market this year, over the last few quarters, than maybe they were 12 months to 18 months ago?", "Hi. Great. Thank you for taking the question. If I take a look at what you're talking about in terms of some deals pushing out and the operator business maybe being a little bit better, and then I contrast that with the guidance and the significantly reduced billings growth rate for calendar 2015, how do we think about, I mean the competitive dynamics? I mean you're saying the win rate is the same. For those of us who were at the Microsoft analyst day yesterday, they say they are gaining a ton of share here, BM Ware is saying they're gaining a ton of share here. That's the part that we're all struggling with and so I would love some more color because it seems hard that everyone can be gaining share in this market. And then secondly, just given kind of where the growth rate is and given the competitive environment probably gets tougher from here, what's the Board thinking regarding strategic decisions for helping to improve shareholder value? Thank you.", "Hi, great, thank you. I'm just trying to, I guess, parse the comment about the end market demand and the competitive advantages MobileIron has, and the Gartner Magic Quadrant with revenue growth rates that continue to decelerate more significantly than certainly what you were talking about when you went public and six months ago. And I'm trying to get a sense of, one, is it because people are concerned about your cash burn rate being as high as it is, given your revenue growth rate? Are you starting to get more questions about that? And two, are people starting to buy as one of the reasons for these pushouts and delays that you were just talking about with Karl, due to the fact that a lot of your existing customers have big VMWare relationships, if these are becoming more CIO-type decisions, are they entertaining, more often than not, buying from a suite provider that they already have a really good relationship about where they don't have to worry about the cash burn trajectory?", "Thank you for taking the question. I guess I had a couple but they're all -- they all seem to be focused on some of the stuff people are asking and I think Michael Turits as well. But the question is, so you're talking about a pipeline that is bigger that sounds robust. It's not closing the way you thought it was so it seems unpredictable. Could you walk us through over the last year how your close rates have changed because I mean technically a pipeline can go up and up and up but if your close rates go down, the pipeline going up doesn't really help us, right? So I guess I am trying to get a sense because it does seem like the market has gotten a lot more competitive; people reference Citrix and VMware and Microsoft and I guess I am just wondering can you share with us how you've seen close rates change, whether it's over the last six months, over the last 12 months and kind of what you're forecasting for those close rates to do? Are you expecting them to increase, decrease, stay the same? And then I had a follow-up. Thank you.", "Hi. Good afternoon. And yes, congrats on your entry into the public market. I just wanted to focus a little bit on the international opportunity and I know you had a couple comments in your remarks. But can you share with us how you expect progress on this to kind of prevail over the course of the next few years? And can you share with us kind of the opportunity on the dealer side, kind of where you stand in terms of the pipeline of getting some of those large MSOs that kind of dominate the European landscape?", "Okay. Thank you. And then, just one last quick one. Obviously you guys are the low cost provider in your go-to-market strategy.

And spinoffs have become more popular. I'm just wondering if you've ever looked at this as an option for any of your business segments? And do you think it would make sense to consider?", "Hi. Great.

Thank you.", "Right. I guess the question was more focused on what does the Board do from here to improve shareholder value creation given the two competitors you just mentioned just have obviously many more deep pockets than you all have. And, look, the other side, if I look at my in-box, people emailing me saying, if it's billings and you're moving more to deferred revenue and it's not the operator stuff, then the billings number should actually be better than the type of growth rate we're looking for. So I think there as lots of people asking me so that's why it would be great to address it. What's the Board's decision tree look like if the environment stays the way it is? How do we think about how the Company is going to improve shareholder value from here in terms of strategic opportunities?", "Great. Thank you very much. I wanted to touch on two quick ones.

I'm trying to get a sense of do you think the environment improved as the quarter went on, meaning was the weakness more pronounced in January or was it more pronounced in February? So that's the second question. And then what have you seen in terms of the deal signing environment and willing to sign deals thus far in March?", "Great, thank you very much for taking the question. I just wanted to ask a little bit about your near-term or your medium-term and long-term operating margin targets.

You've had a lot of great enhancements with Version 7 of your OpenStack platform. I'm just wondering obviously you're running it internally. You've seen some kind of early customers run with it.

I thought in the past, you've talked about it being more like 25% to 30%. And I'm just wondering, are these guys kind of buying in bigger bursts less frequently than they had in the past?

First, I wanted to ask Charlie, if in the past you guys have said that services revenue was actually a good indicator of future growth and subscription, if I just go back in your transcripts. I'm just wondering if the business dynamics have changed and that's not the case anymore. And then I guess the second thing just has to do with Linux workload growth and I'm wondering if you could give us a sense of what rate do you think Linux workloads are growing at within the four walls of your customers' data centers, and what do you think they're growing at in the public cloud arena?

Thank you.", "Great. Thank you very much. Amy, you noted a material improvement in Azure margins this quarter. I was just wondering if you could share with us -- given how quickly revenue is growing in this area, how fast can we see margins ramp, which obviously were negative. And now that you're getting to some big revenue numbers, is there any reason why, at a similar revenue scale you shouldn't be able to match the gross margins of what AWS -- what you can back into from the financials of AWS?

Are you starting to get more questions about that? And two, are people starting to buy as one of the reasons for these pushouts and delays that you were just talking about with Karl, due to the fact that a lot of your existing customers have big VMWare relationships, if these are becoming more CIO-type decisions, are they entertaining, more often than not, buying from a suite provider that they already have a really good relationship about where they don't have to worry about the cash burn trajectory?", "Great, thank you.

You still keep seeing a pretty big deceleration in growth in short-term billings. So I'm just trying to think through, if we just take away the long-term deferred aspect, and whether or not you get people to pay you upfront or not, that trend seems to be -- continue to decelerate from what we used to be the 20%s to this quarter was -- I think it was 14%. And again, I think Walter had highlighted that long-term deferreds are actually growing faster than short-term deferreds.

The cloud providers, I believe you said they were 60% of sales in the period, and obviously the NetScaler business looked really good. I'm just wondering, that does seem higher than normal. I thought in the past, you've talked about it being more like 25% to 30%. And I'm just wondering, are these guys kind of buying in bigger bursts less frequently than they had in the past? Are you seeing any change, I guess, in their buying behavior?

Can you just talk a little bit about what's driving that?", "Great, thank you. I'm just trying to understand this a little bit. We're talking about -- people are talking about the long term and people paying you less upfront. But if we really just focus on your short-term billings, which obviously it doesn't matter, then, whether someone's paying you more than 12 months upfront because it's only getting the stuff that's less than 12 months. You still keep seeing a pretty big deceleration in growth in short-term billings. So I'm just trying to think through, if we just take away the long-term deferred aspect, and whether or not you get people to pay you upfront or not, that trend seems to be -- continue to decelerate from what we used to be the 20%s to this quarter was -- I think it was 14%. And again, I think Walter had highlighted that long-term deferreds are actually growing faster than short-term deferreds. So can you help us reconcile all of the talk about customers paying you less upfront with what's being indicated by the short-term billings trends?

I guess the question was more focused on what does the Board do from here to improve shareholder value creation given the two competitors you just mentioned just have obviously many more deep pockets than you all have. And, look, the other side, if I look at my in-box, people emailing me saying, if it's billings and you're moving more to deferred revenue and it's not the operator stuff, then the billings number should actually be better than the type of growth rate we're looking for. So I think there as lots of people asking me so that's why it would be great to address it. What's the Board's decision tree look like if the environment stays the way it is? How do we think about how the Company is going to improve shareholder value from here in terms of strategic opportunities?", "Great, thank you. I'm just trying to understand this a little bit. We're talking about -- people are talking about the long term and people paying you less upfront. But if we really just focus on your short-term billings, which obviously it doesn't matter, then, whether someone's paying you more than 12 months upfront because it's only getting the stuff that's less than 12 months. You still keep seeing a pretty big deceleration in growth in short-term billings. So I'm just trying to think through, if we just take away the long-term deferred aspect, and whether or not you get people to pay you upfront or not, that trend seems to be -- continue to decelerate from what we used to be the 20%s to this quarter was -- I think it was 14%. And again, I think Walter had highlighted that long-term deferreds are actually growing faster than short-term deferreds. So can you help us reconcile all of the talk about customers paying you less upfront with what's being indicated by the short-term billings trends?

I guess I had a couple but they're all -- they all seem to be focused on some of the stuff people are asking and I think Michael Turits as well. But the question is, so you're talking about a pipeline that is bigger that sounds robust. It's not closing the way you thought it was so it seems unpredictable. Could you walk us through over the last year how your close rates have changed because I mean technically a pipeline can go up and up and up but if your close rates go down, the pipeline going up doesn't really help us, right? So I guess I am trying to get a sense because it does seem like the market has gotten a lot more competitive; people reference Citrix and VMware and Microsoft and I guess I am just wondering can you share with us how you've seen close rates change, whether it's over the last six months, over the last 12 months and kind of what you're forecasting for those close rates to do? Are you expecting them to increase, decrease, stay the same? And then I had a follow-up. Thank you.", "Great, thank you. I'm just trying to understand this a little bit.

But if we really just focus on your short-term billings, which obviously it doesn't matter, then, whether someone's paying you more than 12 months upfront because it's only getting the stuff that's less than 12 months. You still keep seeing a pretty big deceleration in growth in short-term billings. So I'm just trying to think through, if we just take away the long-term deferred aspect, and whether or not you get people to pay you upfront or not, that trend seems to be -- continue to decelerate from what we used to be the 20%s to this quarter was -- I think it was 14%.
