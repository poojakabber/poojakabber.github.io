I just was wondering, you talked about the entry of a lot of new SKUs that are coming out for the holiday season. As we start thinking about building our OEM models, how do we think about ASPs for this 8-inch and below category that you referenced there is a lot of product coming out with?", "Great, thank you very much. My question was related to you mentioned some what like T-Mobile for example meaningful upsell component. I was just wondering if you could share with us what are the biggest upsell products that you are seeing today and if that is different from maybe what you were noticing six to 12 months ago? And then the follow-up question would be if you could give us some color qualitatively around how ASPs trended this quarter versus last quarter?", "OKay. Yes. No, I was just wondering specifically if you had any stats that you could share directionally. How many -- kind of how multi-product customers and maybe the average number of products per customer.", "I was wondering again, and sorry Tony to drill down on this, but following up on what Michael just asked. The people that came out of the woodwork and had more influence on the deals than you thought, is there a common thread as to why they held up the deal signing? Was it macro, was it competition, was it they need more time with the product? Is there any common thread that you can share with us?", "Great. Thank you very much. Just had a couple questions. One, I was wondering if you could give us a sense of how you feel like your EAA progression has been going versus your expectations? And there's a lot of questions that we field during the quarter that as you guys progress there, what happens to pricing, what type of pricing trends are you seeing? And then the follow-up would be on the multi-product front, which you guys talked about a little bit earlier. Can you give us a sense of the percentage of deals -- I know it's early -- that included more than one product in the quarter and how you would expect us to think about that ramp? Thank you.", "Great. Thank you very much. I wanted to ask a little bit about, following up on Jason's question, about the productivity of the sales reps. The first thing we should start with, I did not hear you give a net new customer count for the quarter. I was wondering if you had that to share? And then I have a couple of follow-ups?", "So then how do you think about -- how do you grade the productivity of your sales reps given the numbers that you are signing is either high single or low double-digits each quarter versus the number of reps that you have?", "Okay great thank you for that and just on HipChat, the trends we are seeing around are attach and cross sell into the installed base. Obviously there was a product you guys acquired a couple of years ago. How do you see that attach and cross sell ramping?", "Great, thank you. Satya, I know that Brent asked you about Azure, but I'm just wondering if you could share with us, you mentioned that compute usage on Azure, I think you said more than doubled or nearly doubled, something to that effect. I'm just wondering if you could share with us how you see paths coming along and where do you think we are in getting the easier workloads to the cloud? And are you now starting to see the inflection, given we did see an inflection in growth on a year-over-year basis this quarter where you are starting to see significant production workloads that are on-premise actually starting to move over as well?", "Thank you. In response to the past few questions on sales, I guess I'm wondering, do you also need to see changes in terms of how the sales force is structured in order to get that solution sale that you were referencing to keep before? It seems as if you're talking about specialist sales, but it also seems as if you're looking to start out initially with a broader footprint at the time of initial sales with a broader product footprint. I'm just wondering how do you marry that strategy, and also how important is the SI community in helping you to drive that? Thank you.", "Great. Most of mine have been answered but thank you for taking the questions. I guess I just had one. I was wondering if you could share with us a little bit of, kind of how you are thinking about HipChat and Bitbucket. And just share with us maybe any cross sell trends, into the install base. And in general, maybe how you see your product starting to -- your portfolio of products permeating through an organization. And then I have a couple of follow-ups.", "Great. Thank you so much. I had a question about RHEL 7, and just knowing that customers who are obviously paying maintenance will get that version, how do you think about it from the new capabilities that it might offer that might drive people to add on more products, like Charlie was just mentioning? Or the ability maybe to move to higher end SKUs? And just trying to get a sense of how fast you think the new capabilities you're delivering will kind of be absorbed into the market, and then potentially help accelerate things on the billing side as we look to next year. Thank you.", "Great. Thank you very much, and congratulations. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the leverage you all think you can get out of your desktop install base as you go into accounts with your MDM solutions. And I'm also wondering how you see that product set evolving over time. We've talked to a lot of people about the market in some cases moving to mobile application management. And just wondering, how do you think you're positioned as the market continues to evolve there given your strength in the streaming of applications to people's desktops already? Thank you.", "Great. And one follow-up question. In terms of you mentioned the sales force being somewhat preoccupied with on the XenMobile side. Maybe taking away from some time it might depend on traditional XenDesktop sales. Is this an area where you think eventually you'll need a specialized sales force, or do you do see them coming up to speed on the product and selling them all together?", "Great, thank you. I wanted to follow-up, and nice quarter guys, with some comments that Paul made talking about Atomic and talking about open stack. I was just wondering if you could share with us how you characterize kind of the biggest pain points that customers are facing right now as they look at these technologies to help them?

If you haven't done incentive pricing at the OEM level, is there a chance we could see this strategy going forward, as a way to help lower the price points of consumer PCs and just try and spur demand? Thank you.", "Thank you, and Satya, I'll echo everybody's thoughts that it's great to have you on the call, and hear your perspective. I was wondering if you could share with us the decision recently to offer Windows for free for sub-9-inch devices, and how you think this impacts your share in that arena? And also, how should we think about Windows pricing, given your comment about how Windows is going to play in different market segmentations, how do we see Windows pricing evolving, if at all, for other types of form factors over time?", "Great, thank you so much for your time. I wanted to ask a question about, Satya, about your comment about combining the next version of Windows into one for all devices. And just wondering if you look out, you've got different SKU segmentations right now, you've got enterprise, you've got consumer less than 9 inches for free. The offering that you mentioned earlier that you recently announced, how do we think about when you come out with this one version for all devices, how do you see this changing the go to market and also the traditional SKU segmentation and pricing that we've seen in the past?", "I just wanted to follow up, Amy. Your Commercial Other business continues to have fantastic growth. I'm wondering when you juxtapose that with the growth in the commercial licensing business -- I heard you in terms of the headwinds that you face -- but when we think about it more than one quarter out, we think about the revenue transition as you guys continue to build market share in the cloud, how do we think about the trend in the commercial licensing business in the next year or so?", "Two questions, one was related to the success of the sub-$250 machines that you guys and the market have been seeing. What geos have seen the best uptake for those so far? And just if there is a little bit more color you could share about the drivers of the commercial licensing business. I recognize, obviously, that you guys just give guidance for Q4. But as we look out over the next year or two, what are the big puts and takes, in particular, maybe, on the server and tool side that we need to think about?", "Great, thank you. I just had two questions, pretty quick ones. Just to follow up on Azure. I was wondering if you could share with us what you're seeing the mix between IaaS and PaaS and kind of how you have seen that shift evolve over the last few quarters. Secondly, just to follow up on Walter's question, yes, you definitely have been focussing on the customer relationship management opportunity in the financials market more, but given the big SaaS incumbent already competing in that area, can you share with us, do you think you have the assets you need internally to execute against your long-term goals?", "Great. Thank you very much, and congratulations.

Thank you.", "I will echo everyone's best wishes, Mark. I just wanted to focus, David, on what you think -- I know you're going to announce the review of the operational procedures that you have been going through. But at least going back to Mark Moerdler's original question, when you think about the operational efficiencies and how far you are through what you have been able to achieve, can you give us a sense of ex those, how much more there is left in what you originally we laid out in -- I think it was in January? And then I had a follow up just on the MDM market, following up a little bit on the comments that were made last night. Growth rates for those businesses seem to have slowed for everyone in the market. Just trying to get a sense of what you're seeing from a pricing and bundling perspective. Thank you.", "And then the MDM market?", "Great. Thank you. Just two quick questions. One, David, I was wondering, I know it's early, but in November you gave us some early color on calendar 2017. I'm just wondering if you could give us a sense of, given Q4 results, if you could update us on whether or not that still stands. And then just another question -- and I apologize if this was asked, I was on another call -- you had a competitor last night talking about market share gains. I'm just wondering if you could give a little bit of color on what you're seeing in the end user computing market and how you see the competitive environment evolving. Thank you.", "Great. Thank you. I was just wondering if you could give us a little bit more color on what's driving the increased win rates in virtual computing? How are you seeing the competitive market evolve, and how are you seeing the appetite for the solution? Thank you.", "Great. Thank you so much.

And I'm just wondering if you think it would be important for Red Hat to be involved in that area over time, or would it make sense for you to own the complete stack at some point?", "Great. Thank you very much. I wanted to touch on two quick ones. One, you mentioned that ex those federal deals your contract renewals would have been at about 110%. I'm just wondering if you could put that in context. You guys have been running 120% or better for a while. What type of trend are you seeing that might be ticking that lower? I was also wondering if you could share with us a little bit, as you see more and more workloads go to places like AWS, how you think about the share that you have of the total Linux market versus the share you have on premise? Thank you.", "I just had a couple. I was wondering if you could share with us your hiring plans on the sale side on this year. Do you expect to increase it? I know you don't want to give a number, but can you give us an idea for what percentage growth we might see? And then also, I'm just wondering, given the go-to-market change, what do you see as key in the eyes of customers as helping differentiate you from the competition as a result?", "Okay. And then, I just had a quick follow-up, in regards to, I think it was Rick who asked about pricing. I'm just wondering, do you think the pricing trends that you're seeing are also a function of some of your competitors being a little bit more rational in the market this year, over the last few quarters, than maybe they were 12 months to 18 months ago?", "Hi. Great. Thank you for taking the question. If I take a look at what you're talking about in terms of some deals pushing out and the operator business maybe being a little bit better, and then I contrast that with the guidance and the significantly reduced billings growth rate for calendar 2015, how do we think about, I mean the competitive dynamics? I mean you're saying the win rate is the same. For those of us who were at the Microsoft analyst day yesterday, they say they are gaining a ton of share here, BM Ware is saying they're gaining a ton of share here. That's the part that we're all struggling with and so I would love some more color because it seems hard that everyone can be gaining share in this market. And then secondly, just given kind of where the growth rate is and given the competitive environment probably gets tougher from here, what's the Board thinking regarding strategic decisions for helping to improve shareholder value? Thank you.", "Hi, great, thank you. I'm just trying to, I guess, parse the comment about the end market demand and the competitive advantages MobileIron has, and the Gartner Magic Quadrant with revenue growth rates that continue to decelerate more significantly than certainly what you were talking about when you went public and six months ago. And I'm trying to get a sense of, one, is it because people are concerned about your cash burn rate being as high as it is, given your revenue growth rate? Are you starting to get more questions about that? And two, are people starting to buy as one of the reasons for these pushouts and delays that you were just talking about with Karl, due to the fact that a lot of your existing customers have big VMWare relationships, if these are becoming more CIO-type decisions, are they entertaining, more often than not, buying from a suite provider that they already have a really good relationship about where they don't have to worry about the cash burn trajectory?", "Thank you for taking the question. I guess I had a couple but they're all -- they all seem to be focused on some of the stuff people are asking and I think Michael Turits as well. But the question is, so you're talking about a pipeline that is bigger that sounds robust. It's not closing the way you thought it was so it seems unpredictable. Could you walk us through over the last year how your close rates have changed because I mean technically a pipeline can go up and up and up but if your close rates go down, the pipeline going up doesn't really help us, right? So I guess I am trying to get a sense because it does seem like the market has gotten a lot more competitive; people reference Citrix and VMware and Microsoft and I guess I am just wondering can you share with us how you've seen close rates change, whether it's over the last six months, over the last 12 months and kind of what you're forecasting for those close rates to do? Are you expecting them to increase, decrease, stay the same? And then I had a follow-up. Thank you.", "Hi. Good afternoon. And yes, congrats on your entry into the public market. I just wanted to focus a little bit on the international opportunity and I know you had a couple comments in your remarks. But can you share with us how you expect progress on this to kind of prevail over the course of the next few years? And can you share with us kind of the opportunity on the dealer side, kind of where you stand in terms of the pipeline of getting some of those large MSOs that kind of dominate the European landscape?", "Okay. Thank you. And then, just one last quick one. Obviously you guys are the low cost provider in your go-to-market strategy.

Amy, I wanted to ask if you could share with us how you see the gross margin profile of the Company changing as you continue with your journey to be a devices and services Company? And as you look out to when the transition is complete, and I know you probably don't know when exactly that's going to occur, how do we think about what it will look like?", "Thank you, and Satya, I'll echo everybody's thoughts that it's great to have you on the call, and hear your perspective.

Your Commercial Other business continues to have fantastic growth.

I was wondering, Satya, if you could give us a sense for a high-level commentary about the split of IaaS versus PaaS and Azure? And maybe some color on the growth you see in each of those and how you see them evolving? Then the second question would be related to the launch of Windows 10. You gave the Bing example for the month of September and the solid pull-forward there -- or pull-along there. I'm just wondering if you could share with us any other areas where you're seeing a similar pull along with Windows 10 adoption. Thank you.", "Thank you very much. I was just wondering, Satya, you mentioned, and I know there is been a lot of questions on Azure, but you mentioned strong growth in compute, and SQL usage on Azure being up, I think you said 5 times. I was wondering if you could give us your take on how you see the mix of Azure workloads? Is it right now more new workload growth and it's very little existing workloads moving over? I'm just trying to get a sense for kind of how you see the wave cresting for new workloads versus existing workloads that can migrate over. I'm also wondering if you see it helping (technical difficulties). You mentioned it is like a design win or an ISV win. I am wondering if you could share with us how this might be impacting your share versus, say, 1X or versus other types of infrastructure platforms. Thank you.", "Great. Thank you so much. Satya, I wanted to see if you could share a little bit on Azure? Just how you're thinking about the competitive positioning, versus Amazon, where you think your strengths are, versus them? And also, as the business continues to ramp at such a fast pace, how do we think about the progression in gross margins? I mean, Amazon gives us operating margins. But I guess, I'm wondering, is there a reason you shouldn't be able to reach similar operating margins with Azure at a similar scale, if we went back and looked at the progression that Amazon's been disclosing?", "Great, thank you. Satya, I know that Brent asked you about Azure, but I'm just wondering if you could share with us, you mentioned that compute usage on Azure, I think you said more than doubled or nearly doubled, something to that effect.

Thank you very much. Amy, you noted a material improvement in Azure margins this quarter. I was just wondering if you could share with us -- given how quickly revenue is growing in this area, how fast can we see margins ramp, which obviously were negative. And now that you're getting to some big revenue numbers, is there any reason why, at a similar revenue scale you shouldn't be able to match the gross margins of what AWS -- what you can back into from the financials of AWS? Can you walk us through the puts and takes? And then once you hit that scale point, is it something that we should see inflect pretty quickly? Thank you.", "Thank you and good afternoon. I had a couple of quick questions. One, David, I wanted to know if you're still expecting $30 million from Zenprise for the year? If you could give us a sense of how much of that is license, just so we can think back with the comments you made before? Then can you also share with us how you see NetScaler helping to pull along ByteMobile sales, and how often are these being pitched together, and the opportunity to do that going forward? Then I guess the last thing I would ask would just be if you could characterize the competitive environment with F5? Thank you.", "I just had a question about a lot of large tech companies have been looking at ways to enhance shareholder value of late. And spinoffs have become more popular. I'm just wondering if you've ever looked at this as an option for any of your business segments? And do you think it would make sense to consider?", "I was wondering if you could share with us your goals from the restructuring program in terms of operating margins. I'm bouncing between other calls so I apologize if you mentioned this, but I'm trying to get a sense of should we expect all of this to flow through to the bottom line which, by our math, gets to about a 300 basis point improvement in operating margins? And I know, David, last quarter you had chatted a little bit about having a multiyear margin view. I'm wondering if there's anything you could share with us about how you think about your operating margin goals as we exit this restructuring?", "Great. Thank you. Just two quick questions.

But I wanted to see how you see this trend re-evolving, if at all? Thanks.", "Great, thank you, and happy holidays, guys. I guess I was just wondering, you've been investing aggressively in some very promising secular opportunities. I was just wondering, Jim, if could you share with us how you see these opportunities building in terms of what customers are waiting for, or data sets they're waiting for, to get more aggressive in these areas? And then how do you see these playing out, if you fast forward a few years in terms of the impact on undeferred growth? Thank you.", "Great. Thank you so much for taking the question. I have two relatively quick ones. The first one was just if you could share with us the top three items being requested from the OpenStack community that you think could help accelerate the pace of adoption. And then just because we're getting a lot of it from people related to RHEL 7, if you could compare it to other cycles, other releases of RHEL -- RHEL 6 or RHEL 5. How fast do you think you see the pace of adoption for people migrating over? Thank you.", "Great, thank you.

So that was one, just give us an update on how that's ramping. Then I had a question on how much of an impact Bryan, do you think the decision to focus on new logos versus your commentary about cross sell and upsell how much -- is there a way to give us a sense of how much that's impacting deferreds when we think about your billing forecast for this year?

Thank you.", "Hi. Great. Thank you for taking the question. If I take a look at what you're talking about in terms of some deals pushing out and the operator business maybe being a little bit better, and then I contrast that with the guidance and the significantly reduced billings growth rate for calendar 2015, how do we think about, I mean the competitive dynamics? I mean you're saying the win rate is the same. For those of us who were at the Microsoft analyst day yesterday, they say they are gaining a ton of share here, BM Ware is saying they're gaining a ton of share here. That's the part that we're all struggling with and so I would love some more color because it seems hard that everyone can be gaining share in this market.

But the question is, so you're talking about a pipeline that is bigger that sounds robust. It's not closing the way you thought it was so it seems unpredictable. Could you walk us through over the last year how your close rates have changed because I mean technically a pipeline can go up and up and up but if your close rates go down, the pipeline going up doesn't really help us, right? So I guess I am trying to get a sense because it does seem like the market has gotten a lot more competitive; people reference Citrix and VMware and Microsoft and I guess I am just wondering can you share with us how you've seen close rates change, whether it's over the last six months, over the last 12 months and kind of what you're forecasting for those close rates to do? Are you expecting them to increase, decrease, stay the same? And then I had a follow-up. Thank you.", "Hi. Good afternoon. And yes, congrats on your entry into the public market.

So I'm just trying to think through, if we just take away the long-term deferred aspect, and whether or not you get people to pay you upfront or not, that trend seems to be -- continue to decelerate from what we used to be the 20%s to this quarter was -- I think it was 14%.

I was wondering if you could give us your take on how you see the mix of Azure workloads? Is it right now more new workload growth and it's very little existing workloads moving over? I'm just trying to get a sense for kind of how you see the wave cresting for new workloads versus existing workloads that can migrate over.

I had two questions, Charlie. I was wondering, you guys disclose in your filings how much revenue the US Federal Government does. I was just wondering how much of an impact was federal in the quarter that just ended. We've been hearing that from a lot of companies obviously. Then when you think about how the quarter progressed, we obviously all know that your quarters and every software companies are back end loaded in terms of deal signing. I'm trying to get a sense of do you think the environment improved as the quarter went on, meaning was the weakness more pronounced in January or was it more pronounced in February? So that's the second question. And then what have you seen in terms of the deal signing environment and willing to sign deals thus far in March?", "Great, thank you, and happy holidays, guys. I guess I was just wondering, you've been investing aggressively in some very promising secular opportunities. I was just wondering, Jim, if could you share with us how you see these opportunities building in terms of what customers are waiting for, or data sets they're waiting for, to get more aggressive in these areas? And then how do you see these playing out, if you fast forward a few years in terms of the impact on undeferred growth? Thank you.", "A couple of questions. I was wondering if you could talk about the Cisco partnership that you guys kicked off a year ago, maybe it was nine months ago? So that was one, just give us an update on how that's ramping. Then I had a question on how much of an impact Bryan, do you think the decision to focus on new logos versus your commentary about cross sell and upsell how much -- is there a way to give us a sense of how much that's impacting deferreds when we think about your billing forecast for this year?

But what gives you the confidence that you're going to see things change, given what's going on with sequestration?

Thank you. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about international expansion, and specifically the Securitas pilot? And how do we think about that starting to impact subscription growth?", "Great, thank you. I just had a couple of quick ones. First, Murray, you might have said it, maybe I missed it but what the impact was from the pricing change. If you could just update us on that, what it was in the quarter? And then I had a question around BitBucket and I was just wondering, how do you assess the competitive landscape in that part of the business that you're going after?

I was wondering, Satya, if you could give us a sense for a high-level commentary about the split of IaaS versus PaaS and Azure? And maybe some color on the growth you see in each of those and how you see them evolving? Then the second question would be related to the launch of Windows 10.

I was wondering if you could talk about the Cisco partnership that you guys kicked off a year ago, maybe it was nine months ago? So that was one, just give us an update on how that's ramping. Then I had a question on how much of an impact Bryan, do you think the decision to focus on new logos versus your commentary about cross sell and upsell how much -- is there a way to give us a sense of how much that's impacting deferreds when we think about your billing forecast for this year?

Are you starting to get more questions about that? And two, are people starting to buy as one of the reasons for these pushouts and delays that you were just talking about with Karl, due to the fact that a lot of your existing customers have big VMWare relationships, if these are becoming more CIO-type decisions, are they entertaining, more often than not, buying from a suite provider that they already have a really good relationship about where they don't have to worry about the cash burn trajectory?", "I will echo everyone's best wishes, Mark.

And I'm just wondering, is this something that you'll ultimately be sharing with us, kind of an update on similar to your public cloud milestone that you announced this quarter?"]}, {"name": "revenue", "questions": ["Right. I guess the question was more focused on what does the Board do from here to improve shareholder value creation given the two competitors you just mentioned just have obviously many more deep pockets than you all have. And, look, the other side, if I look at my in-box, people emailing me saying, if it's billings and you're moving more to deferred revenue and it's not the operator stuff, then the billings number should actually be better than the type of growth rate we're looking for. So I think there as lots of people asking me so that's why it would be great to address it. What's the Board's decision tree look like if the environment stays the way it is? How do we think about how the Company is going to improve shareholder value from here in terms of strategic opportunities?", "Hi, great, thank you. I'm just trying to, I guess, parse the comment about the end market demand and the competitive advantages MobileIron has, and the Gartner Magic Quadrant with revenue growth rates that continue to decelerate more significantly than certainly what you were talking about when you went public and six months ago. And I'm trying to get a sense of, one, is it because people are concerned about your cash burn rate being as high as it is, given your revenue growth rate? Are you starting to get more questions about that? And two, are people starting to buy as one of the reasons for these pushouts and delays that you were just talking about with Karl, due to the fact that a lot of your existing customers have big VMWare relationships, if these are becoming more CIO-type decisions, are they entertaining, more often than not, buying from a suite provider that they already have a really good relationship about where they don't have to worry about the cash burn trajectory?", "I just wanted to follow up, Amy. Your Commercial Other business continues to have fantastic growth. I'm wondering when you juxtapose that with the growth in the commercial licensing business -- I heard you in terms of the headwinds that you face -- but when we think about it more than one quarter out, we think about the revenue transition as you guys continue to build market share in the cloud, how do we think about the trend in the commercial licensing business in the next year or so?", "Yes, hi. I had two questions, Charlie. I was wondering, you guys disclose in your filings how much revenue the US Federal Government does. I was just wondering how much of an impact was federal in the quarter that just ended. We've been hearing that from a lot of companies obviously. Then when you think about how the quarter progressed, we obviously all know that your quarters and every software companies are back end loaded in terms of deal signing. I'm trying to get a sense of do you think the environment improved as the quarter went on, meaning was the weakness more pronounced in January or was it more pronounced in February? So that's the second question. And then what have you seen in terms of the deal signing environment and willing to sign deals thus far in March?", "Great. Satya, I had a question for you on Azure. I was just wondering if you could talk about the percentage of Azure revenue coming from ISVs? And then how do you see this helping you compete with AWS? And can you talk about why these partners may be choosing you over the competition? Thank you.", "I just had two. In particular, I wanted to ask a little bit more about the federal business, which you said was weak in the May quarter, but you're expecting improvement next quarter. Can you walk us through what the confidence level is? And obviously you all know it's the end of the government buying cycle, the end of September. But what gives you the confidence that you're going to see things change, given what's going on with sequestration? And the other question is, there's been a lot of talk about OpenStack, and just some of the questions that we've heard already tonight. But when we think about that OpenStack being integrated with RHEL, with your offering now going GA, how should we be realistically thinking about when we start to see that again, not impact revenue, but in terms of a contribution to deferred?", "Just a couple in particular. First, I wanted to ask Charlie, if in the past you guys have said that services revenue was actually a good indicator of future growth and subscription, if I just go back in your transcripts. I'm just wondering if the business dynamics have changed and that's not the case anymore. And then I guess the second thing just has to do with Linux workload growth and I'm wondering if you could give us a sense of what rate do you think Linux workloads are growing at within the four walls of your customers' data centers, and what do you think they're growing at in the public cloud arena? Thanks.", "Great. Thank you, gentlemen. I have two questions. One, I wanted to ask what you make of Amazon's recent Kinesis announcement from their conference last year week and, two, can you share with us the uptake in the quarter of Splunk Cloud and how you see this as a revenue driver for calendar 2014? Thank you.", "Great. Thank you very much. Amy, you noted a material improvement in Azure margins this quarter. I was just wondering if you could share with us -- given how quickly revenue is growing in this area, how fast can we see margins ramp, which obviously were negative. And now that you're getting to some big revenue numbers, is there any reason why, at a similar revenue scale you shouldn't be able to match the gross margins of what AWS -- what you can back into from the financials of AWS?

I mean you're saying the win rate is the same. For those of us who were at the Microsoft analyst day yesterday, they say they are gaining a ton of share here, BM Ware is saying they're gaining a ton of share here. That's the part that we're all struggling with and so I would love some more color because it seems hard that everyone can be gaining share in this market.

I'm just wondering if you could put that in context. You guys have been running 120% or better for a while. What type of trend are you seeing that might be ticking that lower?

Is there any common thread that you can share with us?", "Okay well then that gets to the win rate question so if you can't comment on the number of deals you guys must keep track of win rates so how has win rates been changing over the last six to 12 months because what I was saying is your pipeline -- you talk about the pipeline is really big but obviously close rates are being impacted if pipeline is going up and you're taking down your expectations and pulling guidance so I am trying to get a sense for how your close rates have changed over the last six months or 12 months.", "Hi.

We're talking about -- people are talking about the long term and people paying you less upfront. But if we really just focus on your short-term billings, which obviously it doesn't matter, then, whether someone's paying you more than 12 months upfront because it's only getting the stuff that's less than 12 months. You still keep seeing a pretty big deceleration in growth in short-term billings. So I'm just trying to think through, if we just take away the long-term deferred aspect, and whether or not you get people to pay you upfront or not, that trend seems to be -- continue to decelerate from what we used to be the 20%s to this quarter was -- I think it was 14%. And again, I think Walter had highlighted that long-term deferreds are actually growing faster than short-term deferreds. So can you help us reconcile all of the talk about customers paying you less upfront with what's being indicated by the short-term billings trends? Because maybe I just don't understand it.", "A couple of questions. I was wondering if you could talk about the Cisco partnership that you guys kicked off a year ago, maybe it was nine months ago? So that was one, just give us an update on how that's ramping. Then I had a question on how much of an impact Bryan, do you think the decision to focus on new logos versus your commentary about cross sell and upsell how much -- is there a way to give us a sense of how much that's impacting deferreds when we think about your billing forecast for this year? And then the other question I had was related to DSOs, they were down a bunch than we normally see them in Q1 and I'm wondering is that a sign that the quarter was more front end loaded or if there's anything else you can share with us there? Thanks.", "Great. Thank you so much. I had a question about RHEL 7, and just knowing that customers who are obviously paying maintenance will get that version, how do you think about it from the new capabilities that it might offer that might drive people to add on more products, like Charlie was just mentioning? Or the ability maybe to move to higher end SKUs? And just trying to get a sense of how fast you think the new capabilities you're delivering will kind of be absorbed into the market, and then potentially help accelerate things on the billing side as we look to next year. Thank you.", "Great, thank you. I just had one housekeeping one and then a follow-up. The first one was just regarding contract duration.

But the question is, so you're talking about a pipeline that is bigger that sounds robust. It's not closing the way you thought it was so it seems unpredictable. Could you walk us through over the last year how your close rates have changed because I mean technically a pipeline can go up and up and up but if your close rates go down, the pipeline going up doesn't really help us, right? So I guess I am trying to get a sense because it does seem like the market has gotten a lot more competitive; people reference Citrix and VMware and Microsoft and I guess I am just wondering can you share with us how you've seen close rates change, whether it's over the last six months, over the last 12 months and kind of what you're forecasting for those close rates to do? Are you expecting them to increase, decrease, stay the same? And then I had a follow-up. Thank you."]}, {"name": "bat", "questions": ["So let me ask a question there then.
