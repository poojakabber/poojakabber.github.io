Just to understand, I mean, I guess looking at the volumes you outlined that, you know, clearly, equity index has been a bit of a drag through the first half, and looking at July, that appears to have continued to be the case, and, in fact, volumes look to be as weak as they've been any time since 2006. Is your sense that this is simply cyclical pressure and lack of volatility? Because it looks as though there's something more structural going on. So, I was wondering if there anything to do with high-frequency trading regulations, or other restrictions that could be causing pressure on that line? Thank you.", "Yes, sure. Thanks.
