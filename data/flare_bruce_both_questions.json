Afternoon, guys. I guess two questions. Firstly, just on the collateral management opportunity, how should we think or how do you think about the risks from a Euroclear DTCC joint venture? Because presumably, the natural assumption would be the person who's got the biggest liquidity pool has the best opportunity to provide efficiencies, so I guess that's question one. And then secondly, just on the cost guidance of EUR1.065b, including consolidation effects, given Citco-only impact Q4, and I think the cost is around EUR6m, if I'm thinking about the run rate of cost for a full year, should we be thinking about EUR1.085b.

Just looking at the detailed revenues, the GSF area appears to have had another big drop in quarterly revenues.

And, sorry, just to check on the margins, it looks like quarter-on-quarter revenues from GSF were down 5%, whilst I think outstandings were down 1%.

Just going back to the LCH revenues, particularly in the OTC space, I take your point on alignment, but even after the move up in the profit share, it strikes us from a pricing standpoint your revenue capture is only a fraction of what your large competitor is doing. So should we think about further negotiation both around profit share and around pricing for that service? Secondly, there's been a further debate around systemic risks of clearing houses.

So how do you assess the risk that either there is another change in the capital requirements of clearing houses or other regulatory risks?
