Thank you."]}]}, {"name": "share", "children": [{"name": "Microsoft Corp", "questions": ["Thank you very much. I was just wondering, Satya, you mentioned, and I know there is been a lot of questions on Azure, but you mentioned strong growth in compute, and SQL usage on Azure being up, I think you said 5 times. I was wondering if you could give us your take on how you see the mix of Azure workloads? Is it right now more new workload growth and it's very little existing workloads moving over? I'm just trying to get a sense for kind of how you see the wave cresting for new workloads versus existing workloads that can migrate over. I'm also wondering if you see it helping (technical difficulties). You mentioned it is like a design win or an ISV win. I am wondering if you could share with us how this might be impacting your share versus, say, 1X or versus other types of infrastructure platforms. Thank you."]}]}]}
