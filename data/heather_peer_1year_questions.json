We're talking about -- people are talking about the long term and people paying you less upfront. But if we really just focus on your short-term billings, which obviously it doesn't matter, then, whether someone's paying you more than 12 months upfront because it's only getting the stuff that's less than 12 months. You still keep seeing a pretty big deceleration in growth in short-term billings. So I'm just trying to think through, if we just take away the long-term deferred aspect, and whether or not you get people to pay you upfront or not, that trend seems to be -- continue to decelerate from what we used to be the 20%s to this quarter was -- I think it was 14%. And again, I think Walter had highlighted that long-term deferreds are actually growing faster than short-term deferreds.
