"Amy and Satya, if I look at your Intelligent Cloud segment, and in particular the server products and cloud services, those continue to defy gravity a little bit here. And I'm just wondering if you could just give us a sense of how much maybe the pricing changes that went into effect at the beginning of the quarter that you're in now might have helped drive spending last quarter ahead of them going into effect. But also, can you share with us how the Azure Hybrid Benefit message might also be impacting Azure growth rate?",azure,5700

"I wanted to dig into capital efficiency here around your cloud assets a little bit. This quarter, you talked about Azure gross margins coming in sort of -- continuing to improve really nicely. CapEx came in, I mean, the growth there is slowing a little bit. Can you talk to us about sort of what's kind of driving that? Is it sort of the move to higher-level services? Do you get like better pricing against the capital? Is this sort of you're just not sort of pouring down as much cement, if you will, in terms of data expansion? Is it like better productivity of the core sort of compute stuff? Like can you help us understand sort of how capital intensity is trending in that -- Azure in particular but more broadly in the cloud businesses?",azure,756

"Amy, I'm wondering if you could talk about Azure, the outlook for the year. I know growth rate's been a bit volatile. I think you had a pretty strong Q4, including bookings in that business. Maybe you can help us understand relative to growth we're seeing right now how you expect the Azure trajectory to play out for the year?",azure,650

"Maybe 2 for Amy. Just first on that KPI of Azure plus server products, that high teens number was obviously a lot better this quarter. But is that still the framework for the year?",azure,506
